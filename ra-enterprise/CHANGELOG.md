## v3.1.0

> 2021-03-19

## v3.0.0

> 2021-02-19

**BREAKING CHANGE**
- `Layout` does not accept a `breadcrumb` prop and does not include a default `Breadcrumb` anymore.

Instead we recommend to includes the Breacrumb inside the views directly. This was motivated by the fact that the breadcrumb was taking too much space above the views. In order to keep the breadcrumb in the default react-admin views, we recommend using the alternative versions provided by this package. See below.

- (feat) Add preconfigured `Show` and `List` which includes a Breacrumb in their actions toolbar.
